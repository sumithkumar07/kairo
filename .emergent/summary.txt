The previous AI engineer initiated the task by first exploring the provided codebase. A critical early discovery was that the actual project structure (Next.js with Supabase) contradicted the initial system prompt's description of a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. The AI navigated this discrepancy, initially misinterpreting logs but then correctly identifying the project as a Next.js application.

Following the user's explicit instruction to start doing all in parallel, the AI shifted its strategy from a phased approach to simultaneously implementing features from different priority areas. It began by creating several new files for enhancing the workflow editor (Phase 1) and introducing advanced nodes/performance monitoring (Phase 3). The work concluded with the AI preparing to integrate these newly created components into the main workflow page. This trajectory showcases the AI's ability to adapt its plan based on new information and user directives, while focusing on core feature development for the Kairo application.

<product_requirements>
The product is Kairo, an AI-powered workflow automation platform.
**Current State:**
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Google AI & Genkit.
- **Database:** Comprehensive schema covering workflows, users, subscriptions, and execution history.
- **Core Features:** AI workflow generation, a visual editor, over 30 nodes for various tasks, and user authentication.
- **AI Integration:** Uses Mistral AI for natural language workflow generation.
**Identified Gaps (requiring implementation):**
- Basic workflow editor UX: Lacks snapping, shortcuts, multi-select.
- Limited integrations: Only 15 currently, aiming for 100+.
- Missing enterprise features: Collaboration, team management.
- No mobile responsive design.
- Basic canvas performance needs optimization.
**Proposed Enhancements (User requested parallel implementation):**
- **Phase 1 (Critical):** Enhanced Workflow Editor (Keyboard Shortcuts, Connection Snapping, Multi-Select, Professional UX with Minimap, zoom, alignment guides).
- **Phase 2 (High):** Professional Page Redesign (Landing, Dashboard, Workflow Editor, Settings/Profile).
- **Phase 3 (Medium):** Feature Enhancement (Advanced Nodes, Integration Expansion, Mobile Support, Performance optimization).
- **Phase 4 (Medium):** Production Features (Real-time Collaboration, Enterprise Features, Advanced AI, Deployment Ready).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Next.js 15**: Primary frontend framework for server-side rendering and routing.
- **TypeScript**: Used for type-safe code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**: Backend-as-a-service for database, authentication, and more.
- **Google AI & Genkit**: AI model integration for generative capabilities.
- **Mistral AI**: Specific LLM used for natural language workflow generation.
- **React Flow**: Likely used for the visual workflow editor canvas.
- **Supervisor**: Process manager for running services in the background.
- **Kubernetes Ingress**: Handles routing for application services.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a Next.js project. It does not follow the initial React frontend/FastAPI backend structure described in the system prompt. Instead, it's a unified Next.js application relying on Supabase for backend services.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****: This file defines the project's dependencies and scripts. It confirms the use of Next.js, React, Supabase, Genkit, Tailwind CSS, and other development tools, serving as the definitive source for the tech stack.
- ****: The root layout for the Next.js application. It defines the global HTML structure, metadata, and includes global providers like  and . It's crucial for the application's base UI. No direct modifications were made.
- ****: This file defines the available node types and their properties for the visual workflow editor (e.g., , , ). It's fundamental to the workflow automation logic. No direct modifications, but  was added to expand on this.
- ****: This component is the core of the visual workflow editor, likely integrating . It's central to the Enhanced Workflow Editor phase. No direct changes observed to this file yet, but new components are being built to integrate with it.
- ** (NEW)**: This file was created to implement the minimap feature for the workflow editor, part of the Professional UX enhancement (Phase 1).
- ** (NEW)**: Created for implementing connection snapping and grid alignment in the editor, addressing Connection Snapping (Phase 1).
- ** (NEW)**: Added to enable multi-selection and bulk operations on nodes, fulfilling the Multi-Select requirement (Phase 1).
- ** (NEW)**: Implements keyboard shortcuts for editor functionalities, a key part of Keyboard Shortcuts (Phase 1).
- ** (NEW)**: Created to define and integrate more complex node types like conditional branching and error handling, part of Advanced Nodes (Phase 3).
- ** (NEW)**: Added to monitor and improve the performance of the canvas, addressing Performance optimization (Phase 3).
- ** (NEW)**: Created to expand the range of available nodes for the workflow editor, contributing to Node count and Integration Expansion goals (Phase 3).
- ** (NEW)**: Added, likely to provide predefined workflow templates, enhancing the AI workflow generation aspect.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully integrate the newly created workflow editor components (, , etc.) into the main workflow canvas/page.
- Implement Phase 2: Professional Page Redesign (Landing Page, Dashboard, Workflow Editor, Settings/Profile).
- Complete remaining aspects of Phase 3: Further Integration Expansion (25+ integrations) and Mobile Support.
- Implement Phase 4: Production Features (Real-time Collaboration, Enterprise Features, Advanced AI, Deployment Ready).

<current_work>
The AI engineer's current work is focused on implementing critical features in parallel across multiple phases, as per the user's directive. After correctly identifying the project as a Next.js application (despite initial system prompt confusion), the AI successfully installed dependencies and restarted services.

Immediately before this summary, the AI was working on enhancing the workflow editor and expanding its capabilities. This involved creating several new files:
- , , , and  were added to address the Enhanced Workflow Editor requirements (Phase 1 UX improvements).
-  was introduced to support Advanced Nodes (Phase 3).
-  was created for Performance optimization (Phase 3).
-  and  were added to contribute to node expansion and workflow generation improvements.

The current state is that these new components and configuration files exist within the codebase. The next logical step, explicitly stated by the AI, is to integrate these newly developed features into the main workflow page ( or ) to make them functional within the application's UI.
