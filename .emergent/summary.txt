The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the consolidation of AI features. Initially, the engineer faced challenges in understanding the codebase's architecture, mistakenly assuming a separate FastAPI backend and React frontend. Through systematic exploration and error log analysis, it was correctly identified as a Next.js application, necessitating a crucial pivot in approach. The engineer effectively troubleshooted and reconfigured supervisor settings to correctly run the Next.js development server. Dependencies were installed, and a key step was taken by modifying  to integrate AI Studio features and redirecting the old . The system is now confirmed to be running with the frontend accessible.

The core problem is to improve user experience by consolidating disparate AI features from a separate AI Studio into the main Workflow Editor, eliminating context switching. The vision is an AI-Native Editor with a single workspace where AI management is contextual and integrated. This involves an expanded right panel in the editor with tabs for Assistant, AI Tools, AI Config, AI Analytics, Credentials, and Skills. Specific integration ideas include contextual AI configuration on node selection, inline AI model selection, and progressive AI disclosure based on user expertise. The previous engineer implemented part of this, specifically starting the consolidation of AI Studio into the Workflow Editor. Future consolidations include unifying Analytics into the Dashboard, User Management into a single  hub, and Learning resources into a  hub, with Analytics into Dashboard being the highest priority.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Next.js:** The core full-stack framework for the application, handling both frontend and API routes.
-   **React:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
-   **Supervisor:** Process control system used for managing and running application services (Next.js server, MongoDB).
-   **Consolidation Strategy:** Design pattern for unifying scattered features/pages into single, tabbed interfaces for improved UX.
-   **Kubernetes Ingress:** Rules for routing traffic, implying  prefix for backend routes, although now it's Next.js API routes.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a Next.js project within the  root directory. It deviates from the initial assumption of separate  and  folders.



-   **/app/src/app/workflow/page.tsx**: This is the main workflow editor where AI features from the AI Studio are being consolidated. The AI engineer wrote to this file (though specific content changes are not visible in the trajectory) to begin the integration of AI functionalities, making it a central hub for workflow creation and AI management.
-   **/app/src/app/ai-studio/page.tsx**: This was the standalone AI Studio page. The AI engineer modified this file to implement a redirection, pointing users to the new, consolidated workflow editor, signifying the deprecation of the separate AI Studio page.
-   **/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf**: This critical configuration file manages the application's processes. Initially, it was misconfigured for separate  and  directories. The AI engineer correctly updated it to run the Next.js development server directly from the  root, ensuring the application starts and runs correctly.
-   **/app/package.json**: This file lists Node.js dependencies. The AI engineer used

The frontend is currently running and accessible, as confirmed by a successful HTML response. The next immediate step is to verify the accessibility and functionality of the newly integrated AI features within the workflow editor.
