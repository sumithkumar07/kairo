# **App Name**: FlowAI

## Core Features:

- Workflow Canvas: A visual canvas where users can drag and drop pre-built nodes.
- Node Library: Display a list of available nodes (e.g., HTTP Request, Parse JSON, etc.).
- AI Workflow Generation: Generative AI takes a user's plain-text request for a workflow (e.g., "fetch data from an API, transform it, and save to a file") and creates the corresponding visual workflow automatically. The AI is a 'tool' in that it uses reasoning to decide what nodes and properties to include in the resulting workflow.
- Node Configuration: Configuration panel for each node, allowing users to set parameters (API keys, file paths, etc.).
- Workflow Execution and Logging: Execute the workflow to see the results. Display error messages in the user interface when errors happen during the workflow execution.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to evoke intelligence and connectivity.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F2F5), to make the bright blue 'pop' without being overwhelming.
- Accent color: A muted green (#8BC34A) for positive actions and feedback.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and easily readable UI.
- Simple, flat icons to represent nodes and actions. Use a consistent style to enhance usability.
- Clean and intuitive layout, drag and drop feature and clear visual hierarchy.
- Subtle animations to highlight actions. Loading animations while workflows are running or new nodes being added.
